# 📡 Antenna Radiation Patterns & Beamforming Visualization

This project provides a powerful and interactive Python-based visualization toolkit for simulating **antenna radiation patterns**, **polarizations**, and **beamforming techniques** in 2D and 3D using `matplotlib` and `numpy`. It supports a wide range of antenna concepts, including linear, circular, and elliptical polarization, with intuitive graphics and dynamic control features.

## 🚀 Features

- 📈 **2D and 3D Radiation Pattern Plots**
- 🔄 **Linear, Circular, and Elliptical Polarization Visualization**
- 🧭 **Far-field and Near-field pattern analysis**
- 🎯 **Phased Array Beamforming Simulation**
- 🔊 **Interactive Gain, Phase Shift, and Steering Angle Controls**
- 🧮 Customizable Parameters: frequency, number of elements, spacing, angles, etc.
- 💾 Ready-to-use for academic demos, tutorials, and research presentations
